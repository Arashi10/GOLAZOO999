          <p contenteditable="true" class="">Ultras are a type of association football fans who are renowned for their fanatical support. The term originated in Italy, but is used worldwide to describe predominantly organised fans of association football teams. The behavioural tendency of ultras groups includes singing football chants, playing musical instruments such as drums, their use of flares and smoke bombs (primarily in tifo choreography), frequent use of elaborate displays, vocal support in large groups and the displaying of flags and banners at football stadiums, all of which are designed to create an atmosphere which encourages their own team and intimidates the opposing players and their supporters. These groups also commonly organize trips to attend away games.</p>

          <p class="mb-3 lead text-justify text-white"><b>When Andre Santos asked for Robin van Persie’s shirt at halftime, Arsenal supporters were incensed. Santos was having a poor game anyway, and the quest for van Persie’s shirt should have been far less of a priority than sorting out his defending. In 1966, England beat Argentina 1-0 to advance to the semifinal of the World Cup. Manager Alf Ramsey was disgusted with Argentina’s dirty tactics, to the extent that when he saw one of his players exchanging his shirt after the game, he intervened and pulled it away. The act of swapping shirts is important. It is believed to have originated in 1931, when France beat England for the first time and the French players asked to keep the shirts as a memento. Since then it has been accepted as a form of mutual respect and an acknowledgement of the other player’s efforts during the game. Going back to the FA Cup, if a “giant-killing” team takes down one of the Premier League’s biggest sides, a shirt from a top player can be the pinnacle of a career. Most lower-league sides feature players who have regular jobs away from football, so getting the jersey of one of the world’s best counts for a lot. It’s a reminder of football’s origins—as well as a piece of history, never to be repeated. Which sums up every game ever played, really.</b></p>

          <p class="lead mb-5">From El Clasico to Port Vale vs. Stoke, the rivalry games are often the highlight of the football calendar for each set of fans. The atmosphere in the ground is different, the build up to the game is different, and players who understand the game make an extra effort to give their fans a victory. Of course, it doesn’t always end well. Fan violence was a frequent occurrence, and still occasionally takes place. The Tyne-Wear derby, for instance, now takes place at 12.45pm GMT to ensure that fans have limited drinking time before the game. Of course, this is only a fractional part of the occasion that gets all the attention. Derby games are often good-natured affairs, despite the mutual loathing of each other’s teams. If the team you support takes home no trophies in a season, a derby victory is always the next best thing.</p>
